# Preliminary Analyses: Disgust and Religious Behavior Project
## This repository contains the initial data analysis for the disgust and religiosity project with Dr. Jaime Palmer-Hague, Dr. Kelly Arbeau, and myself.
The data analyzed here stems originally from a class project in Dr. Arbeau's PSYC 322 class, and we continued to collect data over the course of the next year. All of the data has been consolidated into one CSV file in the data folder, and the `data/README.md` contains notes on how the data was cleaned.
