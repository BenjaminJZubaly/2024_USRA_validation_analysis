# Introduction

The following tracks the data analysis for our preliminary study of the relationship between disgust and religiosity. This analysis will inform future studies on the basis for such a relationship. The goals of this analysis are as follows:

1.  Establish the reliability and validity of our religious behavioral intentions scales (see variables in the analysis below).
2.  Estimate the relationship between disgust sensitivity and religiosity in a Christian sample.

Before describing the data set and its' variables, we will clean the data.

## Data Cleaning

I have written a script to clean the data called `data_cleaning.R` which is in the `code` directory of this repository. The following code runs the script, and this script will read in the data (which is currently in the `data` directory as `validation_data_ready.csv`) as `unclean.data`, calculates scores for each scale based on the item scores, format the variables into the correct data types, and return the clean data as a data frame called `data`.

```{r}

```
